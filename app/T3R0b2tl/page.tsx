              This word most the times since you were being here always said by you if you
              feel like confused or need to do something but you don't know what
              to do. I was just guessing though, please no offense üôåüèª. The first I hear I
              thought it was Japanese haha, but turns out to be Korean. Its okay to
              be confused sometimes, because I also did the same most of the times too, if my
              words is kind of "what the..", you'll hear it lot of times coming
              from my desk behind you.
            </p>

              Since the SPM years with our Bro, you reflect this feelings of
              hardwork, and until this time you lead CC. Currently it seems CC
              is the most essential product in our teams, and you carefully take
              care of it along with Angel and Lika in website. Honestly, I lost
              track the most with CC, need to catch it up, but I hope everything
              is good in CC onwards ya Mil. Also it seems the storm coming last week,
              even during your leave, I hope everything get better after this, light comes after the storm isn't it ?
              I also believe your team never did it, hope they got what they deserve after try ruining someone's work üòà

              I also amazed knowing you can speak in chinese, I also have
              compulsory chinese hour during my college, but slowly losing it,
              it was fun and memorable class I remember with the Laoshi coming from the
              chinese itself, she even give us one by one our chinese name.
              I hope the one I gave through those boxes remind you to keep burn your spirits, learning, while also keep your passion on.
